Visit w3schools' HTML tutorial using the link in this directory.  HTML is the language that web pages are written in and rendered in a web browser as the sites we see.

Follow through the tutorial and get familiar enough with HTML to write an about me page (aboutme.html) in a text editor that looks like aboutme.png in this directory.  You can set the background image to any color you'd like.

Save your html file to your desktop and open it in a web browser by double clicking it.  As you edit the code in a text editor, you can click refresh in a browser to see your progress.
