temp.cpp is a Temperature Converter program written in C++.  To run it, it must first be compiled.  To do so, open a terminal (right click in current directory, click Open Terminal) and type the following commands:

# compile temp.cpp using g++ utility and put result in file temp
g++ temp.cpp -o temp
# run the command in the current directory
./temp
# to delete this executable later:
rm temp
