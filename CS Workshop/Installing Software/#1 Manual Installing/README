We're going to download and install Lynx Terminal Web Browser (and you thought Internet Explorer looked bad)

* Open the Link included in this directory.
* Follow the link to download the most recent stable release (lynx2-8-7)
* download the distribution in bzip2 tar format
* Installation instructions are available using the link INSTALLATION
	- there's a lot in there, most of it we won't worry about
	- the important stuff is given to you below
* once the file is downloaded, open it in the archive manager
* drag the directory (lynx2-8-7) to the desktop
* double click the directory to open it
* open a terminal in that directory
* run the following commands (sudo let's you run as an administrator):

# check for any required build dependencies and configure the source
./configure
# build the source
sudo make
# install the program
sudo make install

* now you should be able to run the below command to view facebook.

# launch www.facebook.com in lynx browser
lynx www.facebook.com

* to move around the page, use the arrow keys.  Once you've had enough trying to browse the web like it's 1985, press q to quit, and y to confirm.


# you can uninstall lynx by typing
sudo make uninstall

* the problem with installing software with this approach is:
	- it's time consuming to download, unpack, and compile software
	- some packages depend on other software which will need to be installed first
	- sometimes these dependancy lists are very large (installing software package ABC requires another 50 packages to be installed first)

The next assignment shows how there exist very easy utilities to handle dependancies and installation for you.
