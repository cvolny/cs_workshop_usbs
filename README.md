Readme
=====================

Use this script and files to build live usbs for the 
EECS, CS Summer Workshop. You should build one drive with
a larger 'casper-rw' file for persistance (say 2GB) and 
when it's all setup, place that file into overrides/ to 
be deployed to all duplicate usbs. We only create an 8MB 
file knowing it will be overwritten with a big one.

This has been tested with Ubuntu i386 13.04 (Ring-whatever; who cares)
